Scenario Walk-Through:
An existing customer can login by using defalt id and password to generate a new order. If the order has been created successfully, then our program will provide a order summary including the date of the order, items’ name in the order, and order ID.
 
For instance, the customer can enter the following inputs to prompt:
* id: “root”
* password: “admin”
* item: “carrot”
* quality: “1”
 
login action used JFrame method in LoginGUI class,
Generate order method was called to store item “carrot” in OrderController Use Case
