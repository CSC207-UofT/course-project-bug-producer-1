Scenario Walk-Through:

An existing customer can login by using defalt id and password to generate a new order. If the order has been created successfully, then our program will provide a order summary including the date of the order, items’ name in the order, and order ID.
 
For instance, the customer can enter the following inputs to prompt:
* id: “root”
* password: “admin”
* item: “carrot”
* quality: “1”
 
login action used JFrame class in LoginGUI class as well as in the MainGUI class,
Generate order method was called to store item created in OrderController. the commandline will show the order detail.
